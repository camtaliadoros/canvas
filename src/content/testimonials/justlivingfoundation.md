blurb: 'We want to ensure the causes we support as well as the fund itself, are sustainable. We wish to create a lasting charitable trust, which will continue beyond our lifetimes. The last piece of the puzzle fell into place through our work with Alex. Her passion for supporting small charities, whilst maximising the impact of financial contributions meant a strong alignment with our objectives, so we asked her to work alongside us to achieve our vision and values.'
