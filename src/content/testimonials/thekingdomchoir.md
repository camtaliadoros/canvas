blurb: “We had the pleasure of working with Alex of Canvas who expertly guided us through the process of setting up our Foundation to charity status. Alex has in-depth  knowledge of the process and gave much needed direction in an area of which we had no prior knowledge. Alex is friendly, approachable in her manner, open and she made it clear that we could never ask too many questions. At all times we were made to feel that she was on-side and that she understood our needs and what we wanted to achieve. Alex also helped to develop our forward thinking processes around what would need to happen after the initial set up. We are extremely grateful for all her help and would definitely recommend working with her and her company!.”
