blurb: “Alex led our charitable status application and created our policy documentation covering due diligence, risk and fraud management, conflict of interest and safeguarding in 2023. We would highly recommend Alex in all aspects of charity establishment. She guided us through the journey and made the process really straightforward and simple, explaining both the processes attached to charitable status, but also the requirements for the organisation to meet best practice as set by the charity commission”
