blurb: “My philanthropic journey began when A Girl Called Alex stepped into my office and my life 10 years ago. My journey was a journey of discovery and it was Alex who made me realise that. Together, we planned to build something very special in honour of my Mum and Dad. This felt like nothing short of bringing my parents back to life before my eyes. It was an incredibly moving experience. Alex never met my parents, but I feel she knows them very well.”
