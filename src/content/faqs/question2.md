question: I’d like to set up a charity or a grant making foundation, can you advise on the steps involved? (charity establishment)

Absolutely, through our Charity establishment service, we will guide you and your trustees on all aspects of the process, from deciding on your charitable goals, to managing and submitting your charity application. Then, post status award, if you’d like us to, advise and manage steps relating to HMRC registration, fundraising platforms and gift aid.

Alexandra has established and run many charitable organisations (for families, individuals and companies) and as part of the process can guide and direct operational strategies, all related processes and establish best practice operational policies for the organisation.

We know how daunting the journey can seem and we’re here to simplify things and guide you through each step so you and your trustees feel informed and empowered at each stage.

Please note ‘Foundations’ are legally charities, they are just typically grant-making organisations, whereas the term ‘charity’ is often given to a charitable organisation which delivers services or programmes to beneficiaries.
