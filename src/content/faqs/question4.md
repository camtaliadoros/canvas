question: We want to create or review our charity’s operational and governance policies, can you help?
---

You may already be operating as a registered charity but wish to review and update your operational and governance policies (including conflict of interest, risk and fraud management, due diligence and grant making) or you may be starting your charitable initiative and wish for some policy support.

We offer consultancy across all aspects of charity policies and ensure all policy frameworks are in line with the charity commission’s best practice guidelines. As part of our service we discuss the most important points with your team and trustees to ensure everyone is knowledgeable of the policy and procedural requirements involved.
