question: I’d like to do something in the philanthropy space, but I don’t know where to begin – how do you help?
---

Through our philanthropy and giving strategy, we help clients of all shapes and sizes work through what charitable action they’d like to take, those they’d like to impact and the format of support they’d like to offer.

It may be you’re at the beginning of your journey, (for example you would like to establish a grant making organisation), but you are not sure of your giving motivations or the priority of need you might respond to. We support our clients realise the difference in the world they wish to make, be it specific issues they’d like to respond to (through grant making or service delivery) or values they’d like to uphold.
